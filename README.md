# What's in my Food (using PERN Stack)

The What's in my Food was our final project in the course "410P/510 â€“ Front End Web Technologies" at Portland State University under the guidance of professor "Caterina Paun". We utilized the PERN stack i.e (Postgres, Express, React, Node.js) to accomplish this task. It is a food related application which gives nutritional statistical information of a particular food product.

## Motivation to build this app! 
`As more an more importance for a healthy lifestyle is being realized, it has become difficult to easily find the nutritional statistics of a particular food product,
Thus, we aimed to design a simple minimilistic calorie statistics application which can help a person to understand their food and eating habits better and promote a healthy lifestyle`
